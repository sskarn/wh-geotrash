        <h2>Trash Found Around Brampton</h2>

        <p>At Geotrash we strive Peel spend up to $140 million over the next 10 years to revamp its outdated waste management infrastructure. “The Region looked forward, and we saw that our current system would not sustain our waste management needs over the long term,” said Norman Lee, Peel’s director of waste management. Council’s approval sets in motion a plan to build on existing infrastructure to handle trash. Currently, Peel handles around 565,000 cubic metres of blue box and green bin material every year.</p>
