            <p>Did you know that Americans toss about 60 million water bottles daily, which nearly means 700 each minute which is a lot. Most communities spend more to deal with trash than they spend for te school books, fire protection, libraries and parks.There are more than 3,000 active landfills, and 10,000 - old landfills, in the US. While the number of landfills in the US has been decreasing in the recent decades, they have, individually, been increasing size. These are the trash piles found around the world by our users who have submitted these results.</p>
